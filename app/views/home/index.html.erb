                      <p>Festive frocks and jolly jackets translates to 'leisure suit'. But we didn't really know what that meant and we don't expect you to either, so dress smart but leave your tie at home. We'll be outside and it could be cold, so wear shoes suitable for standing on grass and bring a jacket. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QLSRMoKKS0">It's not Haiti.</a></p>

                      <p>By public transport: We recommend traveling to Blackburn train station (check <a href="http://www.ptv.vic.gov.au">Public Transport Victoria</a> for details). We will be organising a shuttle service between the station to the venue, please let us know if you'd like a lift when you RSVP.</p>
					<p>By car: Melways reference 61 B1. While Canterbury Road is available for parking, our hosts the Hawkeys have recommended nearby Lagoona Court, Vernon Street and Masons Road as quieter places to leave your car.</p>
